[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DimitriMikadze/create-react-library.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DimitriMikadze/create-react-library)
[![Dependencies](https://img.shields.io/david/DimitriMikadze/create-react-library.svg)]()
[![Dev Dependencies](https://img.shields.io/david/dev/DimitriMikadze/create-react-library.svg)]()

based on Facebook's <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app" target="_blank">Create react app</a>.
We are constantly updating repository with the updates of `create-react-app`, so we have all new features and bug fixes of it.

## Converted to custom setup

Moved all dependencies to dev dependencies because we don't need extra dependencies for our library after build, but we want all this features while developing: 

* React, JSX, ES6, and Flow syntax support.
* Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.
* A dev server that lints for common errors.
* Import CSS and image files directly from JavaScript.
* Autoprefixed CSS, so you donâ€™t need `-webkit` or other prefixes.
* A `build` script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production.

## Getting Started

Clone repo

````
git clone https://github.com/srivasd/openvidu-insecure-react-library.git
````

Install dependencies

`npm install` or `yarn install`

Install Openvidu-browser dependency too

`npm i openvidu-browser` or `yarn i openvidu-browser`

Start development server

`npm start` or `yarn start`

_openvidu-server_ and _Kurento Media Server_ must be up and running in your development machine. The easiest way is running this Docker container which wraps both of them (you will need [Docker CE](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community)):

```bash
docker run -p 8443:8443 --rm -e KMS_STUN_IP=stun.l.google.com -e KMS_STUN_PORT=19302 -e openvidu.secret=MY_SECRET openvidu/openvidu-server-kms
```

Runs the demo app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
